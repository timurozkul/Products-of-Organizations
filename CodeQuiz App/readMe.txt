This web application developed by the request of the company Dengun where I was interning. 
Making us of meteor.js framework. This is quiz application where one can create a quiz, 
having the ability to make it private, allowing it to expire after a certain date, and assigning
a category. Also being able to play quizes of different user where scores are kept.
The company will allow future iterns to add furthure features and design work to the app. 
The front-end design was a mere copy paste from another project and was told to neglect it.

This application uses Javascript, Meteor, Mongo DB, JQuery, SASS, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.
